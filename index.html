<p>EButler does all the hard work of researching, contacting, vetting, and adding only relaible and professional service providers in your city so they can be available for you with the tap of a Button. EButler is a one stop shop for services in your phone. Instead of having 50 apps for 50 different kind of services, why not have one App for 150+ services and more? Thats where EButler comes in the picture :)</p>            </div>
